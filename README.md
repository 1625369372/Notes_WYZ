# Notes_WYZ  

This is a introduction to WYZ's notes:

All the notes were written in markdown and authorized by Yongzhe Wang.
I uploaded them to GitHub to encourage myself to stick to my learning plan and make it easier for me to review later.

If there are any visitors, hope you like it.
You should download both the .md and attachments files and open them in a suitable IDE to read the notes correctly.
